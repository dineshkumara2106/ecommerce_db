E-COMMERCE DATABASE PROJECT README
PROJECT GOAL
The objective was to design and implement a simple relational database schema for an e-commerce platform and practice core SQL operations: DDL (creation), DML (data handling), and DQL (retrieval).

TASK 1: DATABASE AND TABLE CREATION (DDL)
This task involved setting up the four interconnected tables using primary and foreign keys.

Database Schema
customers Table

Purpose: Stores user profiles.

Primary Key: Customer_id

Key Constraints: Email must be UNIQUE.

products Table

Purpose: Stores item inventory.

Primary Key: Product_id

Key Constraints: Stock must be greater than or equal to 0.

orders Table

Purpose: Tracks customer purchases.

Primary Key: Order_id

Foreign Keys: Customer_id, Product_id (References customers and products)

Key Constraints: Quantity must be greater than 0.

payments Table

Purpose: Records payment transactions.

Primary Key: Payment_id

Foreign Keys: Order_id (References orders)

Sample CREATE TABLE Syntax
SQL

-- Example: Customers Table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    Customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
TASK 2: DATA INSERTION, UPDATE, AND DELETION (DML)
This task focused on manipulating data and practicing robust data handling using DML statements.

Key Operations Performed
INSERT: Populated tables. Handled NULL for missing phone numbers and relied on the DEFAULT value for Order_status.

UPDATE: Modified Bob Johnson's phone number and changed an Order status from 'pending' to 'delivered' using the WHERE clause.

DELETE: Removed a customer and their associated pending order to demonstrate foreign key constraint management.

Sample UPDATE and DELETE Syntax
SQL

-- Example: Update Data
UPDATE customers
SET Phone_no = '555-0299'
WHERE Customer_name = 'Bob Johnson';

-- Example: Delete Data
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE Customer_id = (SELECT Customer_id FROM customers WHERE Customer_name = 'David Lee');
TASK 3: WRITING BASIC SELECT QUERIES (DQL)
This task involved practicing data extraction and analysis using essential SQL clauses.

Query Objectives and Clauses Used
List all products over $100 and low in stock: Used SELECT, WHERE, AND.

Find payments made within a specific date range: Used SELECT, WHERE, BETWEEN.

Identify customers starting with 'A' OR living in a certain city: Used SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, OR.

Find the top 3 cheapest products: Used SELECT, ORDER BY, LIMIT 3.

Get the details of the most recent order: Used SELECT, ORDER BY ... DESC, LIMIT 1.

Sample SELECT Query
SQL

-- Find products that are low in stock (Stock < 20) AND cost more than $100
SELECT Product_name, Price, Stock
FROM products
WHERE Stock < 20 AND Price > 100.00;
